Medicinal plants have been used for centuries as natural remedies and remain an important source for many modern medicines. In India, traditional systems such as Ayurveda continue to rely on plant-based therapies for maintaining health and treating disease. Yet, identifying these plants accurately is often difficult because many species look very similar, show wide variation in appearance, and require expert taxonomic knowledge. Misidentification can reduce their effectiveness or even pose risks to health. With the rapid growth of mobile imaging and artificial intelligence, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) now offer powerful tools for automated plant recognition. Large datasets, including the "Indian Medicinal Plant Image Dataset" on Kaggle, which contains leaf images of eighty species, make it possible to train models that learn subtle differences and classify plants with high accuracy.

Beyond CNNs, modern object detection techniques such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) bring additional advantages. YOLO is designed for real-time recognition, processing images quickly while detecting and classifying multiple objects at once. Its strengths include speed, accuracy, and adaptability to real-world conditions, making it especially useful for mobile or field-based applications. In this work, "Medicinal Plant Recognition and Recommendation for Proper Therapeutic Use," we propose a framework that combines deep learning and YOLO for identifying medicinal plants and further links the results to verified therapeutic information. By doing so, the system not only helps in recognizing the right species but also guides safe and effective use, supporting both traditional practices and modern healthcareÂ needs.
